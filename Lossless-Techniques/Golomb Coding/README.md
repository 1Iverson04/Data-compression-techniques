# Golomb Coding

## Overview
Golomb Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm based on a simple and efficient method of encoding data. It is particularly useful for encoding data that follows a geometric distribution. The goal of this project is to implement Golomb Coding in MATLAB R2021a and explore its effectiveness in various compression tasks.

## Features
- **Efficient Compression**: Golomb coding provides an efficient method for compressing data with a known distribution.
- **Variable-Length Codes**: The coding scheme adapts to the data's statistical properties, ensuring optimal encoding for specific datasets.
- **MATLAB Implementation**: This project includes a MATLAB implementation for encoding and decoding operations, compatible with MATLAB R2021a.
