A MATLAB implementation of the DEFLATE algorithm combining **LZ77** and **Huffman coding** for lossless data compression.

## Features
- **LZ77 Encoding/Decoding**: Sliding window-based compression.
- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Frequency-based optimal prefix codes.
- **Compression Ratio Calculation**: Metrics to evaluate performance.
- **Modular Design**: Separated encoder/decoder for clarity.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1Iverson04/deflate.git
